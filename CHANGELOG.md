## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-28

First tagged release.

### Added

- IDE shells: Theia browser application, Electron desktop application, and an
  all-in-one Docker deployment (`applications/`).
- Extensions (`extensions/`):
  - `nuke-core` — shared services, environment detection, and health checks.
  - `nuke-essentials` — core IDE workflow features.
  - `nuke-docs` — product documentation readable inside the IDE.
  - `nuke-sysmon` — system monitor widget.
  - `nuke-fileinfo` — file information views.
  - `nuke-visualizer` — trame/ParaView visualization backends with
    local (vtk.js) / remote (server-rendered) view modes.
  - `openmc-studio` — OpenMC workspace: CAD import/conversion, DAGMC tooling,
    statepoint reading, depletion and optimization runners.
  - `nukelab-integration` — NukeLab service integration.
- Python backend test suites with tiered coverage policy (lightweight
  pytest profile for logic, full-dependency profile exercised in Docker).
- CI/CD: fast PR checks (`ci.yml`), cross-platform Electron packaging with
  draft GitHub Releases on `v*` tags (`build.yml`), weekly all-in-one
  container build + smoke test (`docker.yml`), and a weekly latest-upstream
  early-warning job (`upstream-latest.yml`).
- Functional rendering smoke test (`applications/docker/render_smoke_test.py`)
  gating the trame/ParaView/VTK seam in the container.

### Fixed

- Container image now renders headless: `libosmesa6` provides the OSMesa
  software-GL backend (no X server / EGL device in the image).
- `create_view_widget` no longer requires trame-vtk at import time, so the
  lightweight test profile runs without the rendering stack.

### Changed

- Backend conda environment (`applications/docker/environment.yml`) moved to
  an all-conda-forge visualization/CAD stack (paraview 6.1.1, trame, gmsh,
  cadquery, pythonocc-core sharing conda's VTK 9.6.1); the pip
  `cadquery-ocp`/`cadquery_vtk` pins and the Dockerfile's VTK force-reinstall
  repair step are gone.
